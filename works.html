    <h2>Academic Work</h2>
    <p>A WIP section right now. Some major school projects I've completed are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A wishlist creating app done in React, React Native, and Flutter (to learn the differences).</li>
      <li>A movie voting app created in Flutter, where you enter a code, connect to another instance, and swipe until you find a match.</li>
      <li>An iOS app created in Swift that uses the Ottawa public building JSON list to allow users to find places to visit based on category, amenity, or location.</li>
      <li>A .NET Maui program that allows users to upload or take pictures, and uses AI to read the image and use TTS to explain what it is.</li>
    </ul>
